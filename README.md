# 📊 Customer Retention Prediction System

## 🔍 Project Overview
Customer retention is a critical challenge for businesses across industries. When customers stop using a service, it leads to revenue loss and impacts long-term growth.

This project focuses on understanding customer data and building a system that can identify customers who are likely to leave a service. The insights gained can help businesses take timely actions to improve retention.

## 🎯 Business Problem
Customer churn occurs when customers discontinue a product or service. In many cases, organizations realize this only after the customer has already left.

### Key Challenges:
- Late identification of customer dissatisfaction  
- Revenue loss due to customer exits  
- Difficulty in recognizing churn-prone customers early  

The goal is to detect potential churn in advance so that preventive measures can be taken.

## 📂 Dataset Understanding
The dataset used in this project contains information related to telecom customers.

Each row in the dataset represents **one customer**, including:
- 👤 Personal and demographic details  
- 📞 Service subscription information  
- 💳 Billing and account-related details  

The dataset includes a mix of **numerical** and **categorical** columns.

---

## 🎯 Target Variable
The main column of interest is **Churn**:
- **Yes** → Customer has left the service  
- **No** → Customer has continued using the service  

This variable will be used to understand and predict customer retention behavior.

## 📊 Step-1: Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualization (Completed)

### What was done
- Performed exploratory data analysis using Excel
- Analyzed churn patterns using pivot tables
- Created visualizations using Tableau
- Built an interactive dashboard combining key insights

---

### Analysis Performed
- Churn vs Contract Type  
- Churn vs Internet Service  
- Churn vs Payment Method  
- Churn vs Gender  
- Monthly Charges vs Churn  

---

### Key Findings
- Month-to-month contract customers show the highest churn
- Fiber optic internet users churn more than DSL users
- Customers using electronic check payment method have higher churn
- Higher monthly charges increase churn probability
- Gender has minimal impact on churn behavior
- Early-tenure customers are more likely to churn

### Visual Outputs
The following charts were created during analysis:
- Churn distribution
- Churn by contract type
- Churn by internet service
- Churn by payment method
- Monthly charges vs churn
