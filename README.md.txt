📊 Customer Retention Prediction System
🔍 Project Overview
Customer retention is a critical challenge for businesses across industries. When customers stop using a service, it leads to revenue loss and impacts long-term growth.

This project focuses on understanding customer data and building a system that can identify customers who are likely to leave a service. The insights gained can help businesses take timely actions to improve retention.

🎯 Business Problem
Customer churn occurs when customers discontinue a product or service. In many cases, organizations realize this only after the customer has already left.

Key Challenges:
Late identification of customer dissatisfaction
Revenue loss due to customer exits
Difficulty in recognizing churn-prone customers early
The goal is to detect potential churn in advance so that preventive measures can be taken.
